## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Gonzalo
### Social Science code monkey

Currently, part of the European Doctoral School of Demography (2020-2021), working on high skilled migration in Barcelona.

Looking for new challenges (and a Ph.D. program that wants to adopt me :eyes: ).


## Skills: 
 R / Data Science / Sociology / Demography

## Others:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on understanding how pull factors from the different Barcelona's neighborhoods attract high skill migrants, by using classic Demography data and new digital sources. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots of Demographic Theory. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a chess nerd. I've been doing some Analytics to me own games to see how I can improve. There's a repository in here where you can check my analysis.
